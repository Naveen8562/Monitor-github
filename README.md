Monitor Github &amp; Gitlab on Grafana 

Monitoring GitHub and GitLab on Grafana is a great way to track repository activity, CI/CD pipelines, issue status, pull/merge requests, and other metrics. This can be accomplished by collecting metrics from these platforms and visualizing them in Grafana. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can monitor GitHub and GitLab using Grafana.

1. Monitor GitHub on Grafana:
a. Using GitHub API as a Data Source:
GitHub provides a rich set of APIs that can be used to fetch repository metrics like stars, forks, issues, and pull requests. Here's how you can monitor GitHub using the API:

Install and configure a Prometheus exporter for GitHub, like github-stats-exporter.
Set up Prometheus to scrape the GitHub metrics exporter.
Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
b. Steps:
Set up Prometheus GitHub Exporter:

Install a GitHub exporter such as github-exporter, which queries the GitHub API to get repository information (stars, forks, issues, pull requests, etc.).
Configure it with your GitHub account and repositories. You’ll need a GitHub API token for authentication.
Example config for the GitHub exporter:

yaml
Copy code
github:
  token: your_github_token
  repositories:
    - owner: repo_owner
      name: repo_name

Add Prometheus Data Source to Grafana:

Go to Grafana → Configuration → Data Sources → Add Prometheus.
Set the URL to your Prometheus server.
Create GitHub Dashboard in Grafana:

Import pre-made dashboards from the Grafana website or create custom panels using queries that target your GitHub metrics collected by Prometheus.
Example Metrics:
Number of stars on a repository
Open issues and pull requests
Number of commits over time
Releases
2. Monitor GitLab on Grafana:
a. Using GitLab API as a Data Source:
Similar to GitHub, GitLab also provides an API that allows access to repository and CI/CD pipeline metrics. Here’s how you can monitor GitLab:

Install and configure a GitLab exporter like the gitlab-ci-pipelines-exporter.
Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from GitLab via the exporter.
Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana and create dashboards.
b. Steps:
Set up Prometheus GitLab Exporter:

Install the gitlab-ci-pipelines-exporter, which collects metrics on GitLab pipelines, projects, and repositories.
You’ll need a GitLab API token to access the metrics via the exporter.
